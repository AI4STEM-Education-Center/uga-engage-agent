## 1. Strategy — Single Student

**Source:** `app/api/strategy-single/route.ts`
**API:** OpenAI Chat Completions
**Model:** `OPENAI_MODEL` env var (default: `gpt-5-nano`)
**Response format:** JSON object

### System Prompt

```
You are an education engagement planner.
Return JSON only with keys: name, strategy, relevance, overallRecommendation, recommendationReason, summary, tldr, rationale, tactics, cadence, checks.
The strategy must be exactly one of: cognitive conflict, analogy, experience bridging, engaged critiquing.
The relevance field is an object with those four strategies as keys and integer scores from 0-100.
Use the student's two-question quiz (concept understanding and past experience) to justify the recommendation.
Make the recommendationReason reference the student by name and the assignment/topic.
For recommendationReason and rationale, cite 2+ concrete details from the student's answers and connect them directly to the chosen strategy.
```

### User Prompt

```
Student name: {{student.name}}
Assignment: {{student.assignment ?? "Not provided"}}

Questionnaire answers:
{{JSON.stringify(student.answers, null, 2)}}

Return a plan:
- name: short label
- strategy: one of [cognitive conflict, analogy, experience bridging, engaged critiquing]
- relevance: scores 0-100 for each strategy
- overallRecommendation: 1-2 sentences, teacher-facing
- recommendationReason: 2-3 sentences explaining why this strategy fits {{student.name}}; reference the assignment/topic and cite 2+ specific answer details
- summary: 1 sentence
- tldr: 8-14 words, teacher-facing
- rationale: 3-5 sentences; reference the assignment/topic and include at least one concrete in-class example of how the teacher would use the strategy with {{student.name}}
- tactics: 3-5 bullets
- cadence: short phrase
- checks: 1-3 quick checks
```

### Dynamic Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `student.name` | Student's full name |
| `student.assignment` | Assignment or topic (falls back to "Not provided") |
| `student.answers` | JSON object of questionnaire answers |

---

## 2. Strategy — Batch

**Source:** `app/api/strategy-batch/route.ts`
**API:** OpenAI Chat Completions
**Model:** `OPENAI_MODEL` env var (default: `gpt-5-nano`)
**Response format:** JSON object

Uses the **same system and user prompts** as [Strategy — Single Student](#1-strategy--single-student), but called in a loop for each student in the batch. The route aggregates results and returns a strategy distribution across the cohort.

---

## 3. Engagement Plan (with Cohort Context)

**Source:** `app/api/engagement-plan/route.ts`
**API:** OpenAI Chat Completions
**Model:** `OPENAI_MODEL` env var (default: `gpt-5-nano`)
**Response format:** JSON object

### System Prompt

```
You are an education engagement planner.
The plan will be used by teachers to engage students at the beginning of class.
Return JSON only with keys: name, strategy, relevance, overallRecommendation, recommendationReason, summary, tldr, rationale, tactics, cadence, checks.
The strategy must be exactly one of: cognitive conflict, analogy, experience bridging, engaged critiquing.
The relevance field is an object with those four strategies as keys and integer scores from 0-100.
Keep it concise and aligned to the student profile.
For recommendationReason and rationale, be specific: mention the student by name, mention the assignment/topic, and cite 2+ concrete details from the student's answers that justify the strategy.
```

### User Prompt

```
Questionnaire answers:
{{JSON.stringify(answers, null, 2)}}

Student name: {{studentName ?? "Unknown"}}
Assignment: {{assignment ?? "Not provided"}}

{{IF cohortDistribution}}
Cohort strategy distribution:
{{JSON.stringify(cohortDistribution, null, 2)}}
{{END IF}}

{{IF cohortStudents}}
Cohort student answers:
{{JSON.stringify(cohortStudents, null, 2)}}
{{END IF}}

Return a plan:
- name: short label
- strategy: one of [cognitive conflict, analogy, experience bridging, engaged critiquing]
- relevance: scores 0-100 for each strategy
- overallRecommendation: 1-2 sentences, teacher-facing
- recommendationReason: 2-3 sentences; include the student's name, assignment/topic, and 2+ specific details from their answers that justify the strategy
- summary: 1 sentence
- tldr: 8-14 words, teacher-facing
- rationale: 3-5 sentences; name the student, reference the assignment/topic, and give at least one concrete in-class example of how the recommendation would look (what the teacher says/does)
- tactics: 3-5 bullets
- cadence: short phrase
- checks: 1-3 quick checks
```

### Dynamic Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `answers` | JSON object of student questionnaire answers |
| `studentName` | Student name (falls back to "Unknown") |
| `assignment` | Assignment or topic (falls back to "Not provided") |
| `cohortDistribution` | *(optional)* Strategy distribution across the cohort |
| `cohortStudents` | *(optional)* Array of other students' answers for context |

### Differences from Strategy — Single

- Adds teacher-facing framing: *"The plan will be used by teachers to engage students at the beginning of class."*
- Optionally includes cohort distribution and cohort student answers for contextual recommendations.

## 4. Engagement Content

**Source:** `app/api/engagement-content/route.ts`
**API:** OpenAI Chat Completions
**Model:** `OPENAI_MODEL` env var (default: `gpt-5-nano`)
**Response format:** JSON object

### System Prompt

```
You are an education engagement content designer.
Return JSON only with key: items (array). Each item has type, title, body.
```

### User Prompt

```
Student profile:
{{JSON.stringify(answers, null, 2)}}

Engagement plan:
{{JSON.stringify(plan, null, 2)}}

Generate 3 content items:
- Warm-up (short hook)
- Mini lesson (core idea)
- Practice (quick application)
Align the content to the strategy: {{strategy}}.
Keep each body 1-3 sentences.
```

### Dynamic Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `answers` | JSON object of student questionnaire answers |
| `plan` | Full engagement plan object |
| `strategy` | The selected strategy string (may be called multiple times for comparison) |

### Notes

- If `selectedStrategies` contains multiple strategies, this prompt is called once per strategy (in parallel) and the results are merged.

## 5. Engagement Image

**Source:** `app/api/engagement-image/route.ts`
**API:** OpenAI Images (`images.generate`)
**Model:** `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL` env var (default: `gpt-image-1`)
**Output:** 1024x1024, webp, low quality

### Prompt

```
Create a simple, student-friendly illustration for an 8th grade physics lesson.
Topic: {{topic}}
Content type: {{item.type}}
Title: {{item.title}}
Plan: {{planName}}
Description: {{item.body}}

Style: clean, minimal, classroom-friendly.

### Notes

- Grade level is hardcoded to **8th grade**.
- Subject is hardcoded to **physics**.

## 6. Engagement Video

**Source:** `app/api/engagement-video/route.ts`
**API:** Grok / x.ai Video (`https://api.x.ai/v1/videos/generations`)
**Model:** `grok-imagine-video`
**Auth:** `GROK_API_KEY` env var
**Output:** 4 seconds, 1:1 aspect ratio, 480p

### Prompt

```
Animate this still image with natural motion only.
Keep the same scene, style, and subjects.

Focus on subtle movement (camera drift, object motion, lighting/parallax), cinematic and smooth.
Continue the scene as it would unfold in the real world, with physically plausible actions and timing.
Show a complete micro-sequence with a clear beginning, middle, and natural ending within the clip.
Hard requirement: no text anywhere in the video.
Do not add words, letters, numbers, symbols, subtitles, captions, logos, signs, labels, or watermarks.
Do not add narration or lesson explanation.
```

### Input

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `image.url` | URL of the previously generated image |
| `duration` | 4 seconds |
| `aspect_ratio` | 1:1 |
| `resolution` | 480p |

### Notes

- This prompt is **static** (no dynamic variables).
- The video is generated asynchronously; the client polls `app/api/engagement-video/status/route.ts` for completion.
- There is **no audio generation** — the video is a silent animation of the still image.
